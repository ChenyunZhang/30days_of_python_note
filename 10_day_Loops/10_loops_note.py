# while loop and for loop
# Break: We use break when we like to get out of or stop the loop.
# Continue: With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:


# person = {}

# for key in person:
#     print(key)

# for key, value in person.items():
#     print(key, value) # this way we get both keys and values printed out

# for iterator in range(start, end, increment):
#     do something
# else:
#     print('The loop ended')
