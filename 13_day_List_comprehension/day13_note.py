# ******************************************************

# x if y else z is the syntax for the expression you're returning for each element. Thus you need:

# [ x if x%2 else x*100 for x in range(1, 10) ]
# The confusion arises from the fact you're using a filter in the first example, but not in the second. In the second example you're only mapping each value to another, using a ternary-operator expression.

# With a filter, you need:

# [ EXP for x in seq if COND ]
# Without a filter you need:

# [ EXP for x in seq ]
